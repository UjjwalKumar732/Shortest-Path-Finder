This software uses Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-first search algorithm based on userâ€™s choice to find the shortest path between two nodes on a grid. The user has been provided the flexibility to change the start and end positions in the grid by just dragging the respective nodes. After making the required changes, the user can then select any algorithm from the algorithms section. The display box displaying the distance, time, and the number of nodes travelled helps the user to compare various algorithms.

This project also provides the feature of adding obstacles in the form of a wall. If a wall is encountered while traversing the grid, that particular block is skipped and is not visited. Traversing happens until the destination block is reached.

The path is found by traversing the grid from the start node by any of the chosen algorithms, and on visiting the destination node, the path is reconstructed and added up to give the final path.
